# SHALOM!

COVID-19 Update

Like many of you, we have had to adjust our schedule this year.  We will not be holding High Holiday services for 5781 (2020) due to governments regulations and our concern for the safety of our community.  We thank you for your understanding and wish to see you all in good health and your smiling faces next year.

How long has it been since you have attended a Shabbat Service and really enjoyed it?

How long has it been since you have heard a Baal Tefillah that brought back memories of a real “Haymish” Service?

How long has it been since you have enjoyed a Kiddush after a service in a friendly, warm, pleasant atmosphere?

Welcome to KOL YISROEL CONGREGATION where we offer all that and much more!

Kol Yisroel Congregation strives to make the joy of Jewish living accessible and relevant to all.

The Borochov Cultural Centre, in the heart of Bathurst Manor, was established over 40 years ago and houses Kol Yisroel.  A conservative egalitarian congregation, Kol Yisroel, was started in 1991 by Julius Sokoloff and David Newman.

Our congregation meets for Rosh Chodesh and other major holidays. Click here to see our schedule.

We welcome and enjoy Bar/Bat Mitzvahs, baby namings and other family celebrations. High Holiday Services are also conducted.

We invite and encourage you and your family to explore our Shul.
