### COVID-19 Update

Shalom! Like many of you, we have had to adjust our schedule this year. We will not be holding High Holiday services for 5781 (2020) due to governments regulations and our concern for the safety of our community.

With the governments regulations as to how many people would be able to attend and with social distancing policies in place, we estimate that only under 100 persons could be in attendance. Consideration was also given as to how many of you would want to attend services where wearing masks and social distancing would be mandatory as well as the possibility of putting yourselves at risk.

We thank you for your understanding and wish to see you all in good health and your smiling faces next year.

### Upcoming Services

Borochov Cultural Centre and Kol Yisroel Congregation normally conduct Services during Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur that attract families from all areas of Greater Toronto. Over the past 50+ years we have established a congregation of generations. Our family services are conducted in a warm, friendly, comfortable atmosphere with reserved seating at reasonable rates.  We also normally provide babysitting.
