### COVID-19 Update

Shalom! We are excited to announce that we will be holding High Holy Day services for the year 5783 (2022).

We will closely monitor for any changes to government regulations and will adhere to them as well as any recommendations from Ontario Public Health.

We thank you for your loyalty and wish to see you all in good health and your smiling faces this year.

### Upcoming Services

Borochov Cultural Centre and Kol Yisroel Congregation normally conduct Services during Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur that attract families from all areas of Greater Toronto. Over the past 50+ years we have established a congregation of generations. Our family services are conducted in a warm, friendly, comfortable atmosphere with reserved seating at reasonable rates.  We also normally provide babysitting.
